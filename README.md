# IrisDataset
Machine Learning project using KNN algorithm on Iris Dataset.

## Overview

I have done my pilot project on iris dataset using KNearestNeighbor (KNN) algorithm in Machine Learning. At first importing the required libraries as well as iris dataset. Divided the data into two different parts as train and test the data. train the data using KNeighborsClassifier and predicted the output. I have selected Jupyter Notebook for programming interface.
